# Staircase
Steel frame and timber tread staircase

There is a PDF set of plans based on the SKETCHUP cad file. This staircase has been designed for 2730 mm floor height.
You will have to adjust the stair step height and stringer for your own floor heights. 
These stairs are 182mm height and 260mm going. Gives 15 rises of 182 = 2730mm. 
You need to divide your floor height by 15 to get your step height. 
This may impact the angle of the stringer and the length of the going +- 260mm.

You need to check local building codes for maximum step height and adjust number of steps if required.

We designed the steel stair treads to be bolted to the stringer to allow easy galvanising of the staircase. That way it could be dismantled into smaller pieces and transported on small vehicle to get galvanised. This also made it easier to install in smaller sections.

If you are only going to paint the staircase it would be simpler and cheaper to simply weld the steel stair treads directly to the stringer. You would install the stringers in place and then could weld on each tread at the required step height. This will save the extra steel and bolts required for connections.

Good Luck

PS: The staircase is now fully finshed and will upload final video soonish:
