# Staircase
Steel frame and timber tread staircase


There is a PDF set of plans based on the SKETCHUP cad file. This staircase has been designed for 2730 mm floor height.
You will have to adjust the stair step height and stringer for your own floor heights. 
These stairs are 182mm height and 260mm going. Gives 15 rises of 182 = 2730mm. 
You need to divide your floor height by 15 to get your step height. 
This may impact the angle of the stringer and the length of the going +- 260mm.

You need to check local building codes for maximum step height and adjust number of steps if required.

Good Luck
